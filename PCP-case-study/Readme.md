# PCP case study
This case study concerns the transient difference absorption measured after 490 nm
excitation from the peridinin chlorophyll protein (abbreviated PCP), a light-harvesting
complex of oceanic photosynthetic algae. The measurement and the global analysis are described in (van Stokkum et al. 2009), Fig.S6. The target analysis is based upon the model explained in (van Stokkum et al. 2009), Fig.4 and Fig.7.
