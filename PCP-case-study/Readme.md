# PCP case study

This case study concerns the transient difference absorption measured after 490 nm
excitation from the peridinin chlorophyll protein (abbreviated PCP), a light-harvesting
complex of oceanic photosynthetic algae. The measurement and the global analysis are described in ([van Stokkum et al. 2009][vanstokkum2009]), Fig.S6. The target analysis is based upon the model explained in ([van Stokkum et al. 2009][vanstokkum2009]), Fig.4 and Fig.7.
