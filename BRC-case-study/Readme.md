# BRC case study
This case study concerns the transient difference absorption measured in the visible and near-infrared spectral region after 880 nm
excitation from purple bacterial reaction center (RC). The measurement, the global analysis and the target analysis is based upon the model explained in ([Zhu et al. 2013][Zhu2013]).

There are 11 exercise questions in the three notebooks: BRC_VIS-global-case-study-pretty, BRC_NIR-global-case-study-pretty and BRC_VIS_NIR-target-case-study-pretty. The notebooks can only be executed properly when the missing starting values for some of the parameters have been inserted in the relevant parameter files.
